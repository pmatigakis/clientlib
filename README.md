clientlib is a framework that allows the creation of HTTP API clients with only a
few lines of code that declare the payload, response schemas and the urls of the
endpoints.

Checkout the source code from `https://github.com/pmatigakis/clientlib` and read
the scripts in the `examples` folder for instructions on how to use clientlib.
